# SignIn-App
This one is a basic react-native SignIn app where user can SignIn and SignUp only. Entry level project for basic understanding.
This was a task assigned to me by BothOfUs for their recruitment process. Following were the assignment details which I followed:
-> Create a simple Sigin page
-> User would be able to input UserName and Phone Number
I did the same thing with sigin as user email and phone number while for a new user signup button is placed at the bottom. In signup user would be able to input username, email, phone number. 
There is no connection of backend and database it is just a simple signin and signup page on react-native. 
Thankyou.
